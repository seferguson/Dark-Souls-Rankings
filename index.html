<p><h2><strong></strong>all base game bosses + DLC bosses<strong></strong></h2></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Many have attempted to rank all 26 bosses in the From Soft classic game, "Dark Souls," <em>however</em>, all of them are incorrect. 
You may be thinking, "that's just like, your opinion, man."</p>

<p>People also said this in response to Aristotle, upon discovering Earth was round and yet we now 
    laugh at those who argue Earth is flat. I must admit, some rankings have come close to being correct
     but made some naive or blatantly egregious claims. 
</p>
<p><strong>I plan to set the record straight, for once and for all, as a gamer who has 
    an absurd passion for rankings and From Soft.

<p><h3><stronger>26. The Bed of Chaos</stronger></h3></p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm positive that every single person who has played Dark Souls can recall their utter annoyance and disapppintment upon defeating Bed of Choas.
    Bed of Chaos is an incrediably lore-heavy boss that is has familial connections with mulptiple bosses and other characters throughout Dark Souls.
    In short, she is the mother to Ceaseless Discharge, Quelaag, the Fair Lady, Quelana, and even the Corrupted NPC who attacks you outside of the fog gate.
    Setting aside lore, this boss fight has an annoying run-back and is more of an annoying obstacle course that is nearly impossible to successfully overcome first try. 
    My hatred for BOC primarily stems from how underwhelming, anticlimatic, and the overall wasted potentional the boss fight brings.

<p><h3><stronger>25. Gravelord Nito</stronger></h3></p>
<p></p>
<p>Gravelord Nito as the second worst boss fight in Dark Souls is a take that I'm sure many will disagree with - but let me explain.
    Nito's located in the Tomb of Giants, arguably of the worst areas to explore in Dark Souls (in my humble opinion, it IS the worst, but many consider Blighttown to the be the worst).
    This area is totally dark, with the exception of prism stones "illuminating" a path, so a light source is completely necessary. 
    Additionally, there are tons of annoying enemies, and even Patches lurks around and is antagonistic with the player.
    while there are two bonfires in the Tomb of Giants, there still is a significant run back to the boss room, with plenty of enemies to either fight or stealthily avoid.
    Once you finally pass the fog gate, you have to drop down to the arena, and immediately lose a decent amound of HP in the required fall. 
    This is unbelievably frustrating and there is no getting around losing this HP. Thankfully, in later Dark Souls games, this doesn't seem to be an issue (shoutout to the Midir drop-down - imagine losing a chunk of HP from the start for that fight).
    Two more elements that make this fight among one of the worst is the inclusion of respawning skeletons (most normal sized but a few big boys) and the spell Gravelord's Gravelord Dance. 
    First - the skeletons. Unless you are prepared with a divine weapon, these skeletons will continue to respawn and gank you constantly throughout the fight. Gank boss fights generally are always terribly annoying, and frankly poor in design.
    I understand Nito is the Lord of Death, so of course his soldiers are skeltons,
